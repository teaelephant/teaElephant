# WWDC 2025: Hypothetical New Features and Recommendations for TeaElephant

## 1. Introduction

This document explores potential new features and APIs that could be announced at a hypothetical WWDC 2025, and provides recommendations on how they could be used to improve the TeaElephant app. These recommendations are based on current trends in the Apple ecosystem and are intended to be a source of inspiration for the future development of the project.

## 2. Potential New Features and Recommendations

### 2.1. Interactive Widgets with Live Data

**Hypothetical New Feature:**

Widgets become fully interactive, with the ability to display live data and to respond to user input without launching the app.

**Recommendation for TeaElephant:**

*   **"Tea of the Day" Widget 2.0:** An interactive widget that not only suggests a tea of the day, but also allows the user to start a brewing timer, see brewing instructions, and mark the tea as consumed, all directly from the widget.

### 2.2. Advanced ARKit with Object Recognition

**Hypothetical New Feature:**

ARKit gains the ability to recognize and track complex 3D objects in real-time, without the need for markers like QR codes.

**Recommendation for TeaElephant:**

*   **AR Tea Box Recognition:** The app could use ARKit to recognize the tea boxes directly. The user could simply point their camera at a tea box, and the app would automatically identify the tea and display its information.

### 2.3. Proactive Siri and App Intents

**Hypothetical New Feature:**

Siri becomes more proactive and can suggest actions to the user based on their context and habits. App Intents become more powerful and allow for deeper integration with Siri.

**Recommendation for TeaElephant:**

*   **Siri-powered Tea Sommelier:** The user could ask Siri things like, "What's a good tea for a rainy afternoon?" or "How long should I brew my Dragon Well Green Tea?". Siri could then use the information from the app to provide a personalized recommendation or the correct brewing instructions.

### 2.4. Enhanced Create ML and Core ML

**Hypothetical New Feature:**

Create ML gets new templates for building recommendation models, and Core ML gets new APIs for on-device personalization.

**Recommendation for TeaElephant:**

*   **Smarter AI Recommendations:** The app could use Create ML to train a custom recommendation model on the user's tea collection and their personal ratings. This would allow the app to provide even more personalized and accurate recommendations.
