## Notes for Reviewer

Hello,

Thank you for reviewing TeaElephant.

This is a personal project that I created to manage my own tea collection. The app is completely free, with no in-app purchases or advertisements.

The QR code feature is designed to work with pre-existing QR codes that the user has placed on their tea boxes. The app is used to assign tea information to these existing QR codes, not to generate new ones. This allows the user to reuse their QR codes when they get a new tea.

Thank you for your time and consideration.
