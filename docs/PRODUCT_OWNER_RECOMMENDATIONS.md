# Product Owner Recommendations for TeaElephant

## 1. Product Vision

To create a beautiful, simple, and intuitive app that helps tea lovers to manage their tea collection, discover new teas, and enhance their tea-drinking experience.

## 2. User Persona

*   **Name:** Alex
*   **Age:** 35
*   **Occupation:** Software Developer
*   **Bio:** Alex is a tea enthusiast who has a growing collection of different types of teas. They want to keep track of their collection, learn more about the teas they own, and discover new teas to try. They value good design, simplicity, and a seamless user experience. They are not interested in features that are designed to make money, such as ads or in-app purchases.

## 3. Product Roadmap (MoSCoW Method)

### 3.1. Must-Have

These are the essential features that are critical for the app's success.

1.  **Flawless Collection Management:**
    *   **Redesign the "Add New Tea" Flow:** This is the highest priority. The current flow is clunky and inconsistent with the rest of the app. I recommend a multi-step, visually guided process for adding a new tea, with a design that matches the new "liquid glass" aesthetic.
    *   **Comprehensive Tea Details:** The app should allow you to store all the essential information about your teas, including name, type, origin, brewing instructions, and personal notes.
    *   **Effortless Search and Filtering:** You should be able to easily search and filter your collection by any attribute.

2.  **Seamless Tagging:**
    *   **Reliable NFC and QR Code Scanning:** The core functionality of scanning tags to add and identify teas must be flawless.
    *   **Simple Tag Writing:** The process of writing data to a new NFC tag or QR code should be as simple as possible.

3.  **Beautiful and Intuitive UI:**
    *   **Consistent Design:** The "liquid glass" design should be applied consistently across the entire app.
    *   **Clear and Concise Layout:** The UI should be clean, uncluttered, and easy to navigate.

### 3.2. Should-Have

These features are important but not as critical as the must-haves.

1.  **Enhanced Tea Discovery:**
    *   **AI-Powered Recommendations:** The existing AI recommendation feature is a great start. I recommend enhancing it by allowing you to provide more input, such as your mood, the time of day, or the weather, to get more personalized recommendations.
    *   **"Tea of the Day" Widget:** A simple widget that suggests a tea from your collection to try each day.

2.  **Improved AR Experience:**
    *   **Real-time Information:** The AR view should display real-time information about the tea, such as the brewing time remaining.
    *   **Interactive AR Cards:** The AR cards could be made more interactive, for example, by allowing you to tap on them to see more details or to start a brewing timer.

3.  **Better Onboarding:**
    *   **Interactive Tutorial:** A short, interactive tutorial that guides you through the app's key features.

### 3.3. Could-Have

These are "nice-to-have" features that would further enhance the user experience.

1.  **Advanced Statistics:**
    *   **Consumption History:** Track your tea consumption over time and see which teas you drink the most.
    *   **Tasting Notes:** A dedicated section for detailed tasting notes, with a rating system.

2.  **Social Features:**
    *   **Share Your Collection:** The ability to share your tea collection with friends.
    *   **Community Ratings and Reviews:** See what other tea lovers think about the teas in your collection.

### 3.4. Won't-Have (for now)

These are features that are not aligned with the current product vision.

*   **E-commerce Integration:** The app will not be used for buying or selling tea.
*   **Advertisements:** The app will be ad-free.
*   **Complex Social Networking Features:** The focus will be on personal collection management, not on building a social network.
